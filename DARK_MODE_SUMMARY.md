## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Test the following on each page:

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **No Flash:** Load `theme.js` FIRST to prevent white flash
2. **Use Variables:** Always use CSS variables, never hardcode colors
3. **Test Both:** Check every new feature in both themes
4. **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast in both modes
5. **Consistency:** Keep the toggle button in the same place on every page

## 🎨 Customization

### To Change Dark Mode Colors
Edit `dark-mode.css`:
```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
    --bg-primary: #your-color;
}
```

### To Add New Themed Elements
Use existing CSS variables:
```css
.my-element {
    background: var(--bg-card);
    color: var(--text-primary);
}
```

It will automatically work in both themes! ✨
