## üå∏ Special Considerations for HerHaven

As a women's health project, we hold the following additional values:

### Privacy First
- **Never share** personal health information discussed in community spaces
- **Respect boundaries** when discussing sensitive health topics
- **Ask before offering advice** - unsolicited health advice can be harmful

### Inclusive Language
- **Use inclusive terms** when discussing bodies, pregnancy, and reproduction
- **Recognize that** not all people with periods identify as women, and not all women have periods
- **Avoid assumptions** about people's bodies, abilities, or health choices

### Supportive Environment
- **Support without judgment** - everyone's health journey is different
- **Validate experiences** - if someone shares a health concern, take it seriously
- **Provide resources**, not mandates - offer information respectfully
- **Celebrate diversity** in bodies, choices, and experiences
